Hey, thanks for stopping by! ðŸ¦­

My name is Yichen Mo (èŽ«æ€¡æ™¨ in Chinese), and I am an experienced researcher and Ph.D. candidate at Southeast University, where I have been pursuing my doctorate since the fall of 2019 under the guidance of Prof. Biao Li at the Institute of Architectural Algorithms and Applications. My academic journey took a transformative turn when I had the opportunity to serve as a visiting Ph.D. student at the [ITA, ETH. Zurich](http://ita.arch.ethz.ch), under the mentorship of [Prof. Ludger Hovestadt](https://www.caad.arch.ethz.ch) from May 2022 to April 2023.

Having recently returned to Southeast University, I am now resuming my research endeavors with a renewed perspective and a wealth of knowledge gained from my time at ETH Zurich. My work focuses on the cutting-edge applications of **architectural algorithms** and their implications for the built environment, aiming to bridge the gap between theoretical concepts and practical implementations.

Prior to Nanjing, I received my [bachelor degree](https://github.com/amomorning/IPlayout "Click to the project's repository") at Zhejiang Sci-Tech University(ZSTU), majored in **Architecture**. I also received my [second bachelor degree](https://github.com/amomorning/semantic-body "Click to the project's repository") at ZSTU, majored in **Computer Science**.

I was honored with the **DigitalFUTURES YOUNG STAR (2019)** for my innovative work in the intersection of technology and architecture and [Google Girl Hackathon Season V Battle Winner](https://github.com/amomorning/google-girl-hackathon-v "Click to the project's repository"), placing us at the TOP 1 spot.
