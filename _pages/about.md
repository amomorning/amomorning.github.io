Hey, thanks for stopping by! 🦭

My name is Yichen Mo(莫怡晨 in Chinese). I am a PhD student (from fall, 2019) in the Institute of Architectural Algorithms and Applications at Southeast University advised by **Prof. Biao Li**. I've also admitted by a Joint Doctoral Program in the chair of [Prof. Ludger Hovestadt](https://www.caad.arch.ethz.ch) at [ITA, ETH. Zurich](http://ita.arch.ethz.ch).

My research interest are architectural representation learning and geometry processing, designing new algorithms and data structures for architectural data.

Prior to Nanjing, I received my [bachelor degree](https://github.com/amomorning/IPlayout "Click to the project's repository") at Zhejiang Sci-Tech University, majored in **Architecture**. I also received my [second bachelor degree](https://github.com/amomorning/semantic-body "Click to the project's repository") at ZSTU, majored in **Computer Science**.

I am awarded the 2019 DigitalFUTURES YOUNG STAR and [Google Girl Hackathon Season V Battle Winner](https://github.com/amomorning/google-girl-hackathon-v "Click to the project's repository").
